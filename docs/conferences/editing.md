If editing module used together with paper peer reviewing then the latter (which is about the content / scientific correctness of the paper) happens first and "layout reviewing" would likely be disabled, and once the peer reviewing is done, then the paper can be submitted for Editing.

Is possible to use editing without paper reviewing enabled as well: in that case the user uploads a paper or slides or poster for editing and the event organizers will just review if if it's good to be published.

Click on Manage to access the editing management page.
